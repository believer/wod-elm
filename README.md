# WOD Elm

This is a port of my [WOD](https://github.com/believer/wod) project to Elm 0.19.
Mostly for fun and trying out if Elm is a possible contender with my current
favorite ReasonML.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

## Get started

```sh
$ npm i -g create-elm-app
$ g clone https://github.com/believer/wod-elm.git
$ cd wod-elm
$ elm-app start
```
